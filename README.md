# -How-to-watch-main-event-will-feature-Alexander-Volkanovski-vs-Diego-Lopes-

Saturday, April 12, 2025, in the Kaseya Center in Miami, Florida. The fight is for the vacant UFC title at featherweight, after the lightweight switch-up for Ilia Topuria.
Fight Overview
Alexander Volkanovski: The ex-featherweight champion (26-4 record), who lost to Ilia Topuria on UFC 298 three months ago back in February 2024. Reigning champ Volkanovski has spent over a year on the sidelines after being knocked out in back-to-back fights by Topuria and Islam Makhachev. His defeats, though, haven't taken away from his status as one of the most accomplished fighters in the division; he defended the belt five times during his reign.
Diego Lopes: The Brazilian needs no introduction — Lopes (26-6) is a strong contender and is riding a five-fight win streak that includes wins over names like Brian Ortega and Dan Ige. Lopes has demonstrated both heavy hands and great heart, and he poses a significant challenge to Volkanovski. It will be his first title fight in the UFC.
Key Factors
Reason: Volkanovski has been a champion and defended the title multiple times. His durability is a question after recent knockout losses, however.
Lopes’ Roll: Lopes is riding a strong wave and is very confident coming in to this fight. His power and aggression could give Volkanovski issues early.
The Cardio and Strategy Factor: If Lopes can’t find a finish early, Volkanovski’s stamina and knack for in-fight adjustments could turn the tide in his favor.
